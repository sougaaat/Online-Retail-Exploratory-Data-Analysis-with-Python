## Introduction
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from an Online Retail Store. The analysis includes data cleaning, univariate and multivariate analysis, cohort analysis on customer retention, and provides insights and recommendations for business improvement.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to gain actionable insights into the performance of the online retail store. By analyzing various aspects such as product sales, revenue, time-based patterns, geographical insights, and customer behavior, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the business and suggest recommendations for optimization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number of the transaction

- `Quantity`: Quantity of the product in the transaction
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the transaction
- `UnitPrice`: Unit price of the product
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier of the customer
- `Country`: Country where the transaction occurred

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The cleaning process involves handling null values, duplicates, and changing the data type of CustomerID. The dataset is then prepared for analysis.

## Univariate & Multivariate Analysis
Detailed analysis is performed on various aspects, including invoice numbers, products, quantity, invoice date, country, and customer ID. Insights are drawn from each analysis, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the business.
